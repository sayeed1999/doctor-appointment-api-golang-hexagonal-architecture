# doctor-appointment-api-golang

---

In this golang project, I tried to apply all the enterprise level software design practices that I know e.g hexagonal architecture, onion architecture, clean architecture, CQRS, DDD, generic repository pattern..

---

## Golang Packages used:-

- gorm (ORM to communicate with the database)
- gin/gonic (golang framework to build apis)
- gomail (golang package for sending emails from your gmail)
- go-redis (golang package which implements redis)

---

## Architectures targeted:-

- Generic repository pattern (centralizes a common repository for database operations)
- Onion architecture (segregates a monolith project into controller layer, buisness layer, data access layer, domain/entity layer)
- Hexagonal architecture

Any more suggestions please let me know.. :)
